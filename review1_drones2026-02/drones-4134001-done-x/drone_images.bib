              Remote sensing is revolutionizing the phenotyping of agricultural field trials, but for many researchers, the extraction of plot‐level results is a bottleneck. We have developed the R package FIELDimageR as a user‐friendly tool to analyze orthomosaic images containing many plots. The basic workflow involves cropping and rotating the image, followed by the creation of a shapefile based on the experimental design. The package includes functions to calculate the number of plants per plot, canopy cover percentage, vegetation indices, and plant height. FIELDimageR is publicly available as a GitHub repository (

High-throughput unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing platforms have been extensively researched as replacements for more laborious and time-consuming manual field phenotyping. This review aims to elucidate the advantages and challenges of UAV-based phenotyping techniques. This is a comprehensive overview summarizing the UAV platforms, sensors, and data processing while also introducing recent technological developments. Recently developed software and sensors greatly enhance the accessibility of UAV-based phenotyping, and a summary of recent research (publications 2019–2024) provides implications for future research. Researchers have focused on integrating multiple sensing data or utilizing machine learning algorithms, such as ensemble learning and deep learning, to enhance the prediction accuracies of crop physiological traits. However, this approach will require big data alongside laborious destructive measurements in the fields. Future research directions will involve standardizing the process of merging data from multiple field experiments and data repositories. Previous studies have focused mainly on UAV technology in major crops, but there is a high potential in minor crops or cropping systems for future sustainable crop production. This review can guide new practitioners who aim to implement and utilize UAV-based phenotyping.},

            Over the last decade, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for plant phenotyping and field crop monitoring has significantly evolved and expanded. These technologies have been particularly valuable for monitoring crop growth and health and for managing abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought, fertilization deficiencies, disease, and bioaggressors. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the progress in UAV‐based plant phenotyping, with a focus on the current use and application of drone technology to gain information on plant growth, development, adaptation, and yield. We reviewed over 200 research articles and discuss the best tools and methodologies for different research purposes, the challenges that need to be overcome, and the major research gaps that remain. First, the review offers a critical focus on elucidating the distinct characteristics of UAV platforms, highlighting the diverse sensor technologies employed and shedding light on the nuances of UAV data acquisition and processing methodologies. Second, it presents a comprehensive analysis of the multiple applications of UAVs in field phenotyping, underscoring the transformative potential of integrating machine learning techniques for plant analysis. Third, it delves into the realm of machine learning applications for plant phenotyping, emphasizing its role in enhancing data analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, the paper extensively examines the open issues and research challenges within the domain, addressing the complexities and limitations faced during data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. Finally, it outlines the future trends and emerging technologies in the field of UAV‐based plant phenotyping, paving the way for innovative advancements and methodologies.
